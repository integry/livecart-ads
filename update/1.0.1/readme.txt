LIVECART UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS

I.   Please back up your data

It is strongly advised to MAKE FULL BACKUPS of both your files and database before applying the update. Although we're doing our best to make sure that each update can be applied flawlessly, it is not possible for us to guarantee that it will work so on each possible setup.

II.  Applying the update

1) Unpack the archive with update files.

!IMPORTANT! First, please make sure that you have the right update package. Please compare the from.version file from the update package with the .version file in your LiveCart installation directory. Version numbers in these files must match.

2) Upload the unpacked files to your LiveCart installation directory. Allow to overwrite files when prompted.

3) Open the following URL: http://yourstore.com/update/update.php

If the update was successful, you should receive a confirmation message. If you receive any database errors, you may try running http://yourstore.com/update/update.php?force=true to force the update.

If you encounter any problems when updating your LiveCart installation please contact the support team (http://support.livecart.com).
